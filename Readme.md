# Delhi Metro App

## Overview

The Delhi Metro App is a project developed to provide users with the optimal route between stations on the Delhi Metro network. This application includes functionalities to find the shortest path and minimum travel time between two stations using Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Features

- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Find the shortest route between any two stations.
- **Minimum Travel Time Calculation**: Determine the quickest route based on travel time.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for inputting stations and viewing routes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [C++ Compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/rajanarahul93/Delhi-Metro-App.git
    cd Delhi-Metro-App
    ```

2. Compile the project:
    ```sh
    g++ -o DelhiMetroApp Graph.cpp main.cpp
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```sh
    ./DelhiMetroApp
    ```

## Usage

1. Input the starting station.
2. Input the destination station.
3. View the shortest path and travel time provided by the app.
